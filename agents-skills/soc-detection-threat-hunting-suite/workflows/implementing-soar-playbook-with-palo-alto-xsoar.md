# implementing-soar-playbook-with-palo-alto-xsoar

## When this workflow applies

Use to design, review, or implement Cortex XSOAR playbooks for authorized incident workflows, integrations, inputs, approvals, error paths, evidence, and rollback. Live execution requires a connected XSOAR tenant/API and verified integration commands. Do not enable destructive automation or close incidents without explicit approval gates.

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## Overview

Cortex XSOAR (formerly Demisto) is Palo Alto Networks' Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response platform. Playbooks are the core automation engine in XSOAR, enabling SOC teams to automate repetitive incident response tasks. XSOAR provides 900+ prebuilt integration packs, 87 common playbooks, and a visual drag-and-drop editor for building custom workflows. Organizations using SOAR automation reduce mean tim...

## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing soar playbook with palo alto xsoar capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Cortex XSOAR deployed (version 8.x or later, or XSOAR hosted)
- Administrative access for playbook creation
- Integration packs installed for relevant security tools
- Incident types and layouts configured
- API access to external tools (SIEM, EDR, TI platforms, ticketing)

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
