# implementing-cloud-security-posture-management

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## When to Use

- When establishing continuous security monitoring across AWS, Azure, and GCP environments
- When compliance requirements demand automated posture assessment against CIS, SOC 2, or PCI DSS
- When security teams need visibility into cloud misconfigurations across multiple accounts and subscriptions
- When building a security operations workflow that detects and remediates drift from security baselines
- When migrating workloads to the cloud and need to enforce security guardrails
**Do not use** for runtime workload protection (use CWPP tools like Falco or Aqua), for application security testing (use DAST/SAST tools), or for network intrusion detection (use cloud-native IDS like GuardDuty or Network Watcher).

## Prerequisites

- Multi-cloud credentials with read-only security audit permissions across all target environments
- Central logging destination (S3 bucket, Log Analytics Workspace, or Cloud Storage) for findings aggregation
- Notification channels configured (Slack, PagerDuty, email) for critical finding alerts

## Step 1: Deploy Cloud-Native CSPM Services

Enable the built-in CSPM capabilities in each cloud provider for baseline posture assessment.

## Step 2: Run Prowler for Multi-Cloud Assessment

Plan or review Prowler to perform comprehensive security checks across all three cloud providers.

## Step 3: Run ScoutSuite for Cross-Cloud Comparison

Use ScoutSuite for a unified multi-cloud security assessment with visual reporting.

## Step 4: Build Automated Compliance Monitoring Pipeline

Create a scheduled pipeline that runs CSPM checks daily and routes findings to appropriate channels.

## Step 5: Configure Finding Aggregation and Deduplication

Aggregate findings from multiple CSPM tools and cloud providers into a unified view.

## Step 6: Implement Drift Detection and Auto-Remediation

Set up automated responses to configuration drift that violates security baselines.

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
