# implementing-cloud-workload-protection

## When this workflow applies

Use to design or implement cloud-workload protection for authorized compute, container, serverless, and Kubernetes workloads, including runtime telemetry, hardening, identity, network controls, detection, and response. Live changes require the relevant cloud/platform APIs. Preserve availability, privacy, and rollback requirements.

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing cloud workload protection capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with cloud security concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

Monitor cloud workloads for runtime threats by checking process lists, network
connections, file integrity, and resource utilization anomalies.
Key protection areas:
1. Process monitoring for cryptominers and reverse shells
2. File integrity monitoring on critical system files
3. Network connection auditing for C2 callbacks
4. Resource utilization anomaly detection (CPU spikes)
5. Unauthorized binary detection via hash comparison

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
