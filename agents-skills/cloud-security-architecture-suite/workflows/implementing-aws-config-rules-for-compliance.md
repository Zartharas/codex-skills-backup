# implementing-aws-config-rules-for-compliance

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## When to Use

- When establishing continuous compliance monitoring for AWS resources against regulatory standards
- When implementing automated detection and remediation of configuration drift
- When building a compliance dashboard across multiple AWS accounts using AWS Organizations
- When audit teams require evidence of continuous compliance rather than point-in-time assessments
- When deploying guardrails that detect non-compliant resources within minutes of creation
**Do not use** for real-time threat detection (use GuardDuty), for application vulnerability scanning (use Inspector), or for one-time compliance assessments (use Prowler for faster ad-hoc audits).

## Prerequisites

- IAM role with config:*, ssm:*, and lambda:* permissions for rule management
- S3 bucket for Config delivery channel and SNS topic for notifications
- CloudFormation StackSets or Terraform for multi-account rule deployment

## Step 1: Enable AWS Config Recording

Set up the Config recorder and delivery channel in each target account.

## Step 2: Deploy Managed Config Rules for CIS Compliance

Enable AWS-managed Config rules that map to CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark controls.

## Step 3: Create Custom Config Rules with Lambda

Build custom rules for organization-specific compliance requirements.

## Step 4: Configure Automatic Remediation

Set up SSM Automation documents for automatic remediation of non-compliant resources.

## Step 5: Set Up Multi-Account Aggregation

Aggregate compliance data from all organization accounts into a central view.

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
