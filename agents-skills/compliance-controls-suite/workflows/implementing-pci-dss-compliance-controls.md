# implementing-pci-dss-compliance-controls

## When this workflow applies

Use to implement or assess PCI DSS v4.0.1 controls for a defined cardholder-data environment, including scope, segmentation, customized approach, evidence, testing, and responsibility. Verify current PCI SSC publications and effective dates. Do not claim compliance, reduce scope without evidence, or replace a QSA/ISA judgment.

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## Overview

PCI DSS 4.0.1 establishes 12 requirements across 6 control objectives for organizations that store, process, or transmit cardholder data. With PCI DSS 3.2.1 retiring April 2024 and 51 new requirements becoming mandatory March 31, 2025, this skill covers implementing all requirements including the new customized validation approach, enhanced authentication, and continuous monitoring controls.

## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing pci dss compliance controls capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of payment card processing flows and cardholder data environment (CDE)
- Knowledge of network segmentation and security architecture
- Access to cardholder data environment for scoping
- Understanding of PCI compliance validation levels (merchant levels 1-4, service provider levels 1-2)

## Phase 1: Scoping and Assessment (Weeks 1-4)

1. Identify all cardholder data flows (card present, card not present, storage)
2. Define Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) boundaries
3. Validate network segmentation effectiveness
4. Determine compliance validation level
5. Conduct PCI DSS gap assessment against all 12 requirements

## Phase 2: Network and System Security (Weeks 5-12)

1. Deploy and configure network security controls (Req 1)
2. Implement network segmentation to minimize CDE scope
3. Harden system configurations using CIS Benchmarks (Req 2)
4. Implement WAF for public-facing web applications (Req 6.4.1)
5. Deploy anti-malware on all in-scope systems (Req 5)

## Phase 3: Data Protection (Weeks 13-20)

1. Implement encryption for stored cardholder data (Req 3)
2. Deploy tokenization where possible to reduce scope
3. Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all cardholder data transmission (Req 4)
4. Implement key management procedures
5. Deploy data discovery tools to locate unencrypted cardholder data

## Phase 4: Access Controls (Weeks 21-28)

1. Implement RBAC based on business need to know (Req 7)
2. Deploy MFA for all access to CDE (Req 8)
3. Implement unique user IDs for all users
4. Enforce password policies meeting PCI DSS 4.0 requirements
5. Implement physical access controls for CDE facilities (Req 9)

## Phase 5: Monitoring and Testing (Weeks 29-36)

1. Deploy centralized logging for all CDE components (Req 10)
2. Implement automated log review mechanisms
3. Conduct internal and external vulnerability scans (Req 11)
4. Perform penetration testing (internal and external)
5. Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) for critical files

## Phase 6: Policy and Governance (Weeks 37-42)

1. Develop comprehensive information security policy (Req 12)
2. Implement security awareness training including anti-phishing
3. Establish incident response plan specific to cardholder data
4. Conduct targeted risk analyses for flexible requirements
5. Document and validate all controls for assessment

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
