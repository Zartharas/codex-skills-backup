# implementing-policy-as-code-with-open-policy-agent

## When this workflow applies

Use to design, implement, test, or audit policy-as-code with Open Policy Agent, Rego, Gatekeeper, bundles, decision logs, and signed distribution. Trigger for authorization or compliance policy enforcement. Verify OPA/Gatekeeper versions and schemas; never promote an untested deny policy or log sensitive input without review.

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## When to Use

- When enforcing organizational security policies across Kubernetes clusters programmatically
- When requiring admission control that blocks non-compliant resources from being created
- When implementing policy governance that can be version-controlled, tested, and audited
- When standardizing security rules across multiple clusters and environments
- When needing a flexible policy engine that extends beyond Kubernetes to APIs and CI/CD

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with admin access for Gatekeeper installation
- Rego knowledge for policy authoring

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
