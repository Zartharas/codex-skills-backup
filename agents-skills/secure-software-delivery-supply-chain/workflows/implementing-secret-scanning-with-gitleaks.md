# implementing-secret-scanning-with-gitleaks

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## Operating boundaries

- Work only on systems, applications, data, and artifacts the user owns or is authorized to assess.
- Begin with read-only inspection. Treat network requests, execution of untrusted code, active scanning, exploitation, credential use, containment, and configuration changes as explicit actions requiring confirmed scope.
- Keep destructive, disruptive, or externally visible steps in plan-only form unless the user clearly authorizes execution.
- Review installed tools and local documentation before adding dependencies. Never execute an unreviewed remote-install pipeline; verify the source and pin versions when installation is authorized.
- Preserve evidence and record assumptions, commands, timestamps, limitations, and confidence. Redact secrets and sensitive data from outputs.
- Stop when safety, legal authority, production impact, or evidence integrity is uncertain.

## When to Use

- When developers may accidentally commit API keys, passwords, tokens, or private keys to repositories
- When establishing pre-commit gates that prevent secrets from entering the git history
- When scanning existing repository history for previously committed secrets that need rotation
- When compliance requirements mandate secret detection across all source code repositories
- When migrating from manual secret audits to automated continuous scanning

## Prerequisites

- Pre-commit framework installed for local hook integration
- Git repository with history to scan
- CI/CD platform access (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or equivalent)

## Step 1: Install and Run Initial Repository Scan

Perform a baseline scan of the repository to identify all existing secrets in the git history.

## Step 4: Author Custom Detection Rules

Create organization-specific rules for internal secret patterns.

## Step 5: Manage Baselines for Existing Repositories

Create a baseline of known findings to avoid blocking development while historical secrets are being rotated.

## Step 6: Remediate Exposed Secrets

When a secret is detected, follow the rotation and history cleanup procedure.

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
