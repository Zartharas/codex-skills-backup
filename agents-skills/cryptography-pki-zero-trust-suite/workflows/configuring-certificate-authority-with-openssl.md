# configuring-certificate-authority-with-openssl

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## Overview

A Certificate Authority (CA) is the trust anchor in a PKI hierarchy, responsible for issuing, signing, and revoking digital certificates. This skill covers building a two-tier CA hierarchy (Root CA + Intermediate CA) using OpenSSL and the Python cryptography library, including CRL distribution, OCSP responder configuration, and certificate policy management.

## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring configuring certificate authority with openssl capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with cryptography concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution

## Security Considerations

- Root CA private key must be stored offline (air-gapped HSM)
- Use minimum 4096-bit RSA or P-384 ECDSA for CA keys
- Set path length constraints on intermediate CAs
- Implement certificate policies (OIDs)
- Enable CRL and OCSP for revocation checking
- Audit all certificate issuance operations

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Root CA self-signed certificate is valid
- [ ] Intermediate CA certificate chains to Root CA
- [ ] Issued certificates chain to Intermediate -> Root
- [ ] Path length constraints are enforced
- [ ] CRL is generated and accessible
- [ ] Revoked certificates appear in CRL
- [ ] Certificate policies are correctly embedded

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
