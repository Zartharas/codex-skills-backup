# configuring-hsm-for-key-storage

## When this workflow applies

Use to design or implement authorized HSM-backed key storage through PKCS#11, cloud HSM/KMS interfaces, or vendor tooling. Trigger for key lifecycle, partition/tenant design, access control, backup, quorum, audit, and integration. Require the exact HSM, firmware, API, and authorization; never expose key material or claim hardware-backed protection without evidence.

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## Overview

Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are tamper-resistant physical devices that safeguard cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations in a hardened environment. Keys stored in an HSM never leave the device boundary, providing the highest level of key protection. This skill covers configuring HSMs using the PKCS#11 standard interface, including key generation, signing, encryption, and key management using b...

## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring configuring hsm for key storage capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with cryptography concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## HSM validation levels

Use FIPS 140-3 and the current CMVP certificate for new validation decisions. Do not infer that a product is validated merely because it uses approved algorithms or advertises an HSM. Confirm the exact module, version, operational environment, security level, and certificate status. Legacy FIPS 140-2 certificates may still appear in existing environments, but FIPS 140-3 supersedes that standard.

## Security Considerations

- Never export private keys from HSM (use CKA_EXTRACTABLE=False)
- Use separate slots/partitions for different applications
- Implement multi-person key ceremony for CA root keys
- Enable audit logging for all HSM operations
- Implement HSM backup and disaster recovery
- Use strong PINs and enable SO (Security Officer) PIN

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] SoftHSM2 initializes with token and user PIN
- [ ] AES key generates inside HSM
- [ ] RSA key pair generates inside HSM
- [ ] Encryption/decryption uses HSM-resident keys
- [ ] Signing/verification uses HSM-resident keys
- [ ] Keys cannot be exported (non-extractable)
- [ ] Key listing shows all HSM-stored objects

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
