# performing-cryptographic-audit-of-application

## When this workflow applies

Use to audit an application’s cryptographic design and implementation: algorithms, protocols, modes, randomness, key lifecycle, certificates, storage, dependencies, misuse, and migration. Trigger for authorized code/configuration review. Verify claims against current standards and source evidence; do not invent keys, tests, or vulnerabilities.

## Web execution boundary

This Web edition provides analysis, planning, review, templates, and verification guidance. It does not imply that a scanner, cloud account, repository, endpoint, HSM, SIEM, SOAR, or other external system is connected. Begin read-only. Require explicit authorization, confirmed scope, available tools, and rollback conditions before any live action.

## When to Use

- When conducting security assessments that involve performing cryptographic audit of application
- When following incident response procedures for related security events
- When performing scheduled security testing or auditing activities
- When validating security controls through hands-on testing

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with cryptography concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Security Considerations

- Review both application code and configuration files
- Check third-party dependencies for known crypto vulnerabilities
- Verify certificates and TLS configurations on deployed servers
- Ensure secrets are loaded from environment variables or vaults
- Review key storage and rotation practices

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Scanner detects all injected test weaknesses
- [ ] MD5/SHA-1 usage for security purposes is flagged
- [ ] ECB mode usage is flagged
- [ ] Hardcoded keys/passwords are detected
- [ ] Weak KDF parameters are identified
- [ ] Report includes severity, location, and remediation
- [ ] False positive rate is below 10%

## Required output discipline

- Separate observed evidence, source-supported facts, inference, assumptions, and recommendations.
- State tool and data limitations explicitly.
- Preserve exact technical literals, measurements, citations, and user-approved constraints.
- Provide validation steps, unresolved issues, residual risk, and the next authorization gate.
- Never claim execution, access, containment, compliance, certification, or verification that was not observed.
